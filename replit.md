## System Architecture

**Status**: Not yet defined

This repository does not contain any code or configuration files that would indicate architectural decisions. The following aspects remain to be determined:

2. Application structure and organization patterns
3. Data flow and state management approaches
4. Code organization principles
5. Testing strategies
